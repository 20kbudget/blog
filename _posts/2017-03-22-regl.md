title: Exploring Regl
---

**Quick update**: I continue exploring different webgl frameworks, and after finding
[regl][regl] I feel that this is a very good match for me and an elegant approach 
for the renderer part of web-based games.

However, I don't have the needed shader programming background to start using it 
properly (as in: knowing what each line of code does), I can hack copy pasted code 
and get the results I look for, but that's no excuse for not learning the basis properlyâ€¦

So, I started "attending" the [shader-school][shaderschool], that is an incredible
interactive workshop that covers important and basic concepts of the [OpenGL Shading Language][glsl] (GLSL).
