title: Hello World pt. I
---

Today I started a [simple Android app][hello world]
just to get my feets wet, test my stack and start writing
the basics of a building system based on
Javascript tooling.

I have been using [Pixi][pixi] as the framework of choice
to draw things on canvas (aka a WebGL framework). It has
good documentation and covers most of the stuff
needed for a 2D webgame.

As a tool to wrap the game inside an android WebView
and to pack it as an apk [Cordova][cordova] fits the purpose.

[Browserify][browserify] is a simple to use
javascript dependencies bundler,
and since I also need a development webserver,
there are options that goes well with browserify,
such as [budo][budo] or [bankai][bankai].

[Budo][budo] is a complete and mature option,
but I decided to give [bankai][bankai]
another shot, because it has a "build" command
to copy the bundles to a folder.

Content policy of cordova gave me errors
regarding the use of eval (new Function)
by the Pixi library, possibly [this bug][pixi bug].

The solution for now was
to [include a 'unsafe-eval'][unsafe eval]
in the meta tag of the html.

There is not much to see butâ€¦ [here is the release of the day][release],
super ugly!
