title: Racing Game
---

Ok, so I forked my [hello world][hello] into a different project: a [racing game][road].

It is still with the purpose of working as a sandbox to test and improve my
modules and theories, and most likely won't be the final game of this journey.

This is for practice, like a musician or a painter does drafts and scales. My strategy 
is to work on short sprints and build the building blocks that could be used on any 
other project. I need to accumulate experience, feel the performance trade-offs for myself, 
test different markets by launching crappy games, I need to build up portfolio.

I would like to have some stuff to show before the first [ICO][ico] round (I am planning to do 5 or 6 
in total). I need demos with good gameplay to give confidence to my investors. And I dont want
to spend lots of time planning or writing a detailed project document **knowing
that making software is like writing a novel** and several things **wil change** along the way.

The kickstarter model wont work here. My approach is bottom-up.

Anyways, if I want to practice, experiment and jam, participating in "game jams" is
a good thing.

[Itch.io][itch] has a nice [calendar][jams] of those events, and I may use them as
excuse to create, publish and having people testing my demos....

### About the "road" demo

This is the game I am building for the [Resist Jam][resist], I will use [fantastic 
free assets][assets] from [kenney][kenney] and I am in the proccess of figuring out
how a racing game will fit the theme yet, but have a pretty good insights already.

Here is the [first release][release], and it is super boring because it is not interactive, it is
just an animation of a top-down road passing by.
