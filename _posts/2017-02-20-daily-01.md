## Distribution Channels

I got some time to spend in front of the computer
this weekend and used it to research / compare different
distribution channels: Apple App Store, 
Google Play, Steam, Cidya, 
[Humble Store][humble store], [fDroid][fdroid],
[IPFS][ipfs], and of course the World Wide Web.

The advantages of publishing a game on a mainstream
digital store such as Apple Store or Google Play
are undeniable big and super attractive.

I know that people happily trade software-freedom, 
privacy and descentralization for convenience. 
I am guilt of that too :( 
So the centralized digital silos and unethical 
walled gardens is **where the audience, and therefore
the money, is**. Which is bad, I knowâ€¦

My plan is to start developing a great and "[libre][libre]"
web-game, **with the web as primary distribution channel
and Bitcoin as the payment network**.

And, nothing is stopping me from creating a crippled-down
version of it, in order to conform with
bullshit polices from those stores (hooray relicensing)
wrap it in a native shell and publish it on 
less-free channels that have a potentially bigger
revenue and audience.

Having it available on fDroid and Humble Store would be great too.

## Timetrap

So I've installed [timetrap][timetrap] to [log my
