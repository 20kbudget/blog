title: Hello World pt. 2
---

So, my [simple cordova Android app][hello20k] has a working
build system and a local dev environment.

I can ``` yarn start ``` to test it in the browser, then ``` yarn build ```
to make a bundle that can then run on my plugged android phone with ``` yarn debug ```
and if I am happy with the results I can generate a minified release with ``` yarn release ```
aren't [npm scripts][npmscripts] great? :)

And since the android app shell is done, lets continue to use this 
repo as a *sandbox/playground* to test other things!

## Pull streams and user interaction

I like the idea of dealing with input events as
infinite sequences, as event streams. Frameworks like [Cycle.js][cyclejs]
are based on [that idea][cycledataflow].

[Streams][stream] are a neat abstraction, as well as [observables][observable].
And [pull-stream][pullstream] is a very elegant pattern to handle streams.

So I decided to check if pull-streams would be a good fit for 
interactive programs like games.

And I made my hello world text displayed on screen be a 
sequence of hello worlds of different colors (source) that
is consumed by the screen (sink), but throttled by user
clicks (through).

And of that click pull stream throttler I've made a small
npm module that implements this in the context of
the [Pixi.js API][pixiapi].

It's called [pull-pixi-sprite-event][pullpixi].

And here is the [release 0.3.2][032] of the hello world app for android.
