those subjects:

I guess the reason for not updating this diary in the previous days was that 
I havent gave up completely to the imperative-way totally yet and I am spending lots of
time coding and reasoning a lot on how to write my games in a way 
that is data-based and in a manner that is readable/maintainable/testeable
and still with good performance.

I feel that I am falling in a trap here, wanting to have my cake and
eat it too, and that I may fail horribly because of constant refactoring
and analisys paralisys. Like many others before me.

Anyways, I am also enjoying this potentially unhealthy procrastination,
so that's fine for now. I intent to be back on track next week and
to have better news and prototypes to show soon :P
