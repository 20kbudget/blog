title:  "Raising funds: what is a Crowdsale?"
---

Projects demands resources, and funding is always a challenge.

Among the available options for an indie developer or an indie development studio to raise money for a project, we have some
options that are quite common and well tested, such as:

- sell the car
- burn of personal economies
- get a loan
- work for a company (and develop the project on your free time)
- ask for donations
- apply for a grant
- start a crowdfunding campaing
- start a company and sell securities of it in a highly regulated market, with different rules on each country

And there is another one, that is quite popular in the crypto-currencies space:

- sell digital assets (tokens) representing some reward

This last option is the one I am most interested in, since the issuance of tokens is simple and it is flexible enough
for different kinds of arrangements. They can be used to:

- pay dividends for the token-holders
- give refunds on failure
- give token-holders voting rights
- represent some phisical reward
- represent ownership in the project
- be traded in the free market, or used as currency

Basically you have enough flexibility to come up with any set of your own crazy rules, and even write software to enforce
some of your made-up rules if you are inclined to go on that path.

People use the terms **crowdsale**, or **ICO** (initial coin offer), or **equity crowdsale** to describe those digital
assets sales and differentiate it from traditional equity crowdfunding.

There are different platforms, blockchains and protocols available for doing a crowdsale,
some of them are built on top of Bitcoin, some on top of Ethereum and others. The Bitcoin network is the most 
secure because of proof of work and adoption.
