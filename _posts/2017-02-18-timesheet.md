I am on a quest to figure out if it is possible to make money with
a low budget independent game, among [other things][the bet].

In order to monitor how well I am doing, to give feedback and transparency
to any potential [investors][crowdsale] and even for my own control
of where and how fast I am spending the arbitrary budget
of 20k dolllars that I have set, I need to somehow log all my [expenses][expenses].

So if I hire an illustrator, a writer, a developer or some other kind of
artist, my plan is to document that cost.

At the moment, I haven't raised funds yet, and the only person
that I know available to work without compensation for me is myself :)

But that's not really true as well, because I will be investing my
time in this one-person-team, so I figure I must do something that I
really dislike, and that is filling up **fucking timesheets**.

That way I will be able to pay myself eventually, which is nice.

So I will be testing a couple of options this weekend, I think I prefer
CLI and simple ones, although I have used web based ones in the past 
and they are quite OK as well ([toggl][toggl] comes to mind). But nothing super fancy,
I will just pick any half-decent one (maybe [timetrap][timetrap]) and get this out of my way.
