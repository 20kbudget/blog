Main question:
-------------

Can a good indie game be written on a shoestring budget?

Secondary questions:
-------------------

- Can a project based on openness, transparency and free licences make money to it's investors?
- Is it possible to make a commercially successful mobile app with a budget of under 20k dollars?
- How difficult would it be to raise money for developing such an app?
- What kind of team would be necessary?
- Do I have the skills necessary to lead this effort and make it happen?

That's the challenge, the experiment, the journey I am starting today.
I want to figure out how far can a project that challenges stablished business models go.

Mostly likely I will fail.

But if you want to follow my exploration and discoveries please stick around.
